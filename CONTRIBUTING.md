# Adding a new bank

1. Fork the [Banks DB](https://github.com/Ramoona/banks-db) repository and then clone your fork.
2. Create new JSON file in `banks` folder and name it same as your bank title (lowercase).
3. Fill your JSON with this guide (all properties are required):
    * `name`: bank codename in lowercase (same as your file name)
    * `prefixes`: array of bank prefixes (each prefix must contain 5 or 6 digits)
    * `country`: two letters code of bank country ([ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2))
    * `localTitle`: bank title in local language
    * `engTitle`: bank title in English
    * `url`: link to official bank website
    * `color`: bank brand color from official logo or website

    {
      "name": "mybank",
      "prefixes": [
        12345,
